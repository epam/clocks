## What is that?

`Clocks` is a small serverless web application that allows you to create a dashboard for keeping track of time anywhere in the world.

- Free to use — no ads.
- No account registration needed.
- Add as many widgets as you need, searching by location name or timezone.
- See time difference between any of selected locations.
- Add arbitrary comments to every widget, that are stored in your browser, not in our servers.
- Get a sharable link to send dashboard as you see it (with comments) to other users.
- Embed into another HTML page via <iframe> — with no restrictions from our side.
- Supports Dark or Light theme, or automatically switches between them.
- Choose between 12h or 24h time representation.
- Adjust widget details and re-order widgets on the dashboard.

### How to use

- Ctrl+Q: opens "Add new city"
- Esc: lose "Add new city"
- Tab: switching to next element

## For Contributors

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
